## Hey there! ✨

I'm xCoderSai, also known as Catherine De Mesa (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻. A few of my roles include being a Support Intern @ Trill Project (Fall 2020), Apprentice Fellow @ Anita Borg (Spring 2021!), and a previous moderator over at STEM Network Discord Server. I am currently a moderator over at /r/GirlsWhoCode and the affiliated Discord Server!
Being originally a Psychology Major, I switched over in Fall 2019 -> Cybersecurity, and haven't looked back!

A few projects I have in the works include a Blockchain Justice project, a few executable Windows viruses (I don't recommend downloading them,) and perhaps reworking my website. All of my repositories are open for the public for full transparency. 

If you wish to ⭐ collaborate ⭐ on a project, feel free to talk to me. (◕‿◕✿) 🥰
